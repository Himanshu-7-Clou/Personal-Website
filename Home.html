            <h2 class="h2heading2">Startup</h2>
            <p>
                A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered, startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder. At the beginning, startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential. Some startups become unicorns; that is privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion.

            <p>Startups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The founder of a startup will begin market validation by problem interview, solution interview, and building a minimum viable product (MVP), i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models. The startup process can take a long period of time (by some estimates, three years or longer), and hence sustaining effort is required. Over the long term, sustaining effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes. Having a business plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future. Typically, these plans outline the first 3 to 5 years of your business strategy.</p>

            <h3>Lean StartUp:</h3>
            <p>Lean startup is a clear set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at a lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it.[13] The empirical test is to de/validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a build‚Äìmeasure‚Äìlearn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely, it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically, lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:</p>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>find a problem worth solving, then define a solution</li>
                <li>engage early adopters for market validation</li>
                <li>continually test with smaller, faster iterations</li>
                <li>build a function, measure customer response, and verify/refute the idea</li>
                <li>evidence-based decisions on when to "pivot" by changing your plan's course</li>
                <li>maximize the efforts for speed, learning, and focus</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>Design Thinking:</h3>
            <p>Design thinking is used to understand the customers' need in an engaged manner. Design thinking and customer development can be biased because they do not remove the risk of bias because the same biases will manifest themselves in the sources of information, the type of information sought, and the interpretation of that information. Encouraging people to ‚Äúconsider the opposite‚Äù of whatever decision they are about to make tends to reduce biases such as overconfidence, the hindsight bias, and anchoring.</p>
